# Chess Arbiter mobile app

Here you'll find everything you need to know about playing chess, laid out in simple, easy-to-understand language. Our handbook is available in multiple languages. You can create your own tournaments and count rating changes

## How it works

We dynamically request data from our [handbook](https://chessarbiter.info/) and display it in the tab.

The calculation of ratings and the creation of tournaments takes place in the application itself; the data is stored on the userâ€™s device without access from outside.
